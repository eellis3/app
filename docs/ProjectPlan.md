# Project Plan

**Author**: Team35

## 1 Introduction

This document describes the project plan for the development of SmoothieCart, a payment and rewards management system for smoothie carts that runs on the Android platform. The goals of SmoothieCart are to allow costomers to pay via credit card and provide rewards for the most loyal customers.

## 2 Process Description
### Inception Phase
#### Description
During this phase the team will meet to discuss the basic idea for the SmoothieCart system and establish the vision and scope of the end product.  This vision will be based on available customer background information and requirements.  It will guide the team's development of an initial set of documents.  These documents will serve as a starting point for the project design and will lay out the basic uses of the system.
#### Entrance Criteria
- Project idea 

#### Exit Criteria
- Initial project plan document
- Initial vision document
- Initial use case model document
- Initial project design document
- Stakeholder concurrence on scope, definition, and cost/schedule estimates

### Elaboration Phase
#### Description
Ensuring a thorough understanding of the problem domain, the team will extend the basic project design and develop a mature architectural foundation for the system.  This will include the generation of low level design models, test cases, and an executable prototype. The initial use cases that were defined in the previous phase will be expanded into a complete (or nearly so) use case model in which all use cases and actors are identified.  Any high risk elements discovered while developing use cases will be identified and addresssed, or have a mitigation plan established.  Requirements that cannot be directly associated with a use case will be identified and documented.  The team will evaluate the current project plan and make revisions as necessary to ensure that the project meets cost, schedule, and deliverable requirements.
#### Entrance Criteria
- Successful completion of the inception phase
- Stakeholder concurrence on initial scope, project definition, and cost/schedule estimates
- Preliminary drafts of the vision, project plan, project design, and use case model documents

#### Exit Criteria
- Mature vision document
- Mature project design document
- Mature use case model document
- Complete test plan document
- Updated (if necessary) project plan document
- Stakeholder buy-in on project vision given the current plan
- Acceptable actual resource expenditures versus expected expenditures
- Prototype showing risk identification/mitigation

### Construction Phase
#### Description
During this phase team developers will begin development of the actual product.  Traceablitity between use cases and test cases will be documented. Quality assurance team members will ensure that all features are developed and fully tested.  Product verification and validation will be performed to guarantee that the developed system performs correctly, and that the correct system was developed.  A user manual will also be created.
#### Entrance Criteria
- Successful completion of elaboration phase
- Stable project design
- Mature use case model
- Complete test plan

#### Exit Criteria
- All use cases are realized with traceability information
- Complete software product that is integrated on the Android platform
- Complete set of system tests results
- Finalized user manual
- Complete set of artifacts:  design documents, code, and test cases
- Stable product ready for deployment to users
- Stakeholders ready for transition into user community
- Acceptable actual resource expenditures versus expected expenditures

### Transistion Phase
#### Description
During this phase the product will be deployed and the team will focus on product maintenance.  Bug reports will be documented and addressed.  Additionally, feature requests and environment changes will be documented and evaluated for inclusion in future releases.  The team will also provide training and customer service as needed.  
#### Entrance Criteria
- Successful completion of construction phase
- All test cases pass
- All documentation is up-to-date and complete

#### Exit Criteria
- Complete project
- Product in use
- Documented lessons learned
- Plan for next release
- User satisfaction
- Acceptable actual resource expenditures versus expected expenditures
